What follows are example Python Programs, Jupiter Notebook Examples, as well as Project Requirements, and helpful tips that were referenced throughout the Udacity - AI Programming with Python Curriculum.  They have been provided here, not only for my continued reference/learning, but in the hopes to assist others that find themselves on the path to Artificial Intelligence.  Just make certain to accredit Udacity for these reference matters as I, in the event you find yourself using some of the logic in your own code.
